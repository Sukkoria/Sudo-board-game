This is a wider, enhanced version of the [Sudo/Ludo board game](http://turnoff.us/geek/sudo-board-game), created by [turnoff.us](http://turnoff.us) (kudos to
him!).

== Material ==
To play, you need to print four tiles corresponding to four different distros, and their associated
Tuxes.

There are two ways to do it :
* Compose your playing board using Gimp or another image editing software, then print the finished
  board.
* Print as many distro boards as you wish, then choose which ones you want to use and place them on
  the table. This way, each player can print and take care of his favorite distro board.

You can choose to print twice as much Tuxes, to glue them together and get double-sided cute
pinguins !

== Rules ==
Rules are to be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_(board_game)).

Have a nice play, and donâ€™t forget to improve your game with new distros or variants !
